What is cloud?
"Cloud" in tech usually refers to cloud computing, which means using the internet to access computing resources like servers, storage, databases, software, and moreâ€”instead of running them on your local computer or physical servers.

Here's a simple way to think about it:
Imagine you used to store all your photos, documents, and apps on your own computer. But now, services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or iCloud let you store and access your stuff online from any device. Thatâ€™s the cloud in action.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Cloud Computing:
On-demand access: Use what you need, when you need it.

Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down.

Cost-efficient: Pay only for what you use (no need to buy physical hardware).

Remote access: Access from anywhere with an internet connection.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Cloud Services (the "cloud stack"):
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
You get raw computing resources (like servers or storage).
E.g., AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute Engine.

PaaS (Platform as a Service):
You get a platform to develop and deploy apps.
E.g., Heroku, Firebase, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

SaaS (Software as a Service):
Ready-to-use software over the internet.
E.g., Gmail, Google Docs, Netflix.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Cloud Deployment:
Public Cloud: Services offered over the internet to everyone (like AWS, Azure).

Private Cloud: Used by one organization, more control and security.

Hybrid Cloud: Combines both public and private for flexibility.
