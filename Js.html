// call
// Ans: The call() method in JavaScript is used to invoke a function with a specific this value and arguments passed individually.

let obj1 = {
    name: "shafi"
}

function hello(){
    console.log("Hello" +", "+ this.name);
}

hello.call(obj1)

// bind
// The bind() method in JavaScript is used to create a new function with a specific this value and predefined arguments.

const person = {
    name: "shafi",
    
}

function greet(){
    console.log("Hello, "+ this.name);  
}

const greet1 = greet.bind(person)
greet1()

// Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
// The server generates the complete HTML for the page and sends it to the browser.
// The user sees the content immediately when the page loads.

// csr
// The browser loads a basic HTML file from the server.
// A JavaScript file (like React or Angular) runs in the browser.
// JavaScript creates and updates the content on the page.
// The page is built and shown directly in the browser without needing to reload.

// The <!DOCTYPE> declaration ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode rather than quirks mode.

// Standards mode: Browser follows modern HTML and CSS specifications.
// Quirks mode: Browser mimics the behavior of older browsers (used for backward compatibility).

// 1. What are arrow functions?
// Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. 
// Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression. Arrow functions are declared without the function keyword. If there is only 
// one returning expression then we don‚Äôt need to use the return keyword. curly braces { } can be omitted.


// Prototype Design Pattern?
// The Prototype Design Pattern allows you to create objects based on a template object (prototype) rather than creating them from scratch.

const carPrototype = {
    start() {
      console.log(`${this.make} ${this.model} is starting...`);
    },
    stop() {
      console.log(`${this.make} ${this.model} is stopping...`);
    }
  };

  const car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.make = 'Toyota';
car1.model = 'Camry';

car1.start(); // Output: Toyota Camry is starting...
car1.stop(); // Output: Toyota Camry is stopping...

12. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.
Ans. Function takes another function as an argument.

Example 1:
function higherOrderFn(){
    return function(){
        return "Doing Something"
    }
}

var x = higherOrderFn();
x(); // Output: Doing Something

Example 2:
function higherOrder(fn) {
    fn();
  }
higherOrder(function() { 
    console.log("Hello world") 
}); 

14. Explain ‚Äúthis‚Äù keyword.
Ans: "this" keyword refers to current class object.

Example:
let obj = {
    name: "shafi",
    getName: function(){
        console.log(this.name)
    }
}
obj.getName()

13. Explain Callback Functions in javascript.

14. Refrential equality in react js?
when page rerenders then functions will get recreated.

15. what is event bubbling?
Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root.

<div class="outer">
    <div class="inner">
        <button class="button">click</button>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- output -->
<!-- 1) button
2) inner
3) outer -->

16. what is event capturing?
Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event starts from the root element and travels down to the target element.

we need to pass true in case of event capturing.

<div class="outer">
    <div class="inner">
        <button class="button">click</button>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- output -->
<!-- 1) outer
2) inner
3) button -->

17. what is event delegation?
the combination of event bubbling and event target.

I've had a great experience at my current company, where I've grown both technically and professionally over the past 2.3 years.
 I've worked on several meaningful projects, improved my skills in [mention specific technologies, e.g., MERN stack], and 
 collaborated with a talented team. However, I now feel ready to take on new challenges that can help me expand my skill set 
 further, work on more complex or large-scale applications, and contribute to a dynamic environment where I can continue to 
 grow and add more value. I'm particularly excited about opportunities that allow me to work on innovative projects and keep 
 learning new technologies.


 Based on my experience, skills in mern-stack development, and the current market standards, I was expecting something
  around ‚Çπ10lakhs to ‚Çπ12 LPA. 


  Scale-Out in MongoDB (Horizontal Scaling)
Scale-out in MongoDB is achieved using a feature called Sharding.

üîπ What is Sharding?
Sharding is the process of distributing data across multiple servers (called shards) to handle large datasets and high throughput.
